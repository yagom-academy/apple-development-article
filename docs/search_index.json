Right for Your App\nCloudKit이 당신의 앱에 적합한지 결정하세요.\nExplore various ways of storing your app’s data in iCloud.iCloud에 앱의 데이터를 저장하는 다양한 방법을 살펴봅시다.\n\nOverview\n개요\nThere are several ways you can store app and user data in iCloud. This article describes the various options and their suitability for your app. Each option has trade-offs in complexity, access to iCloud features, and control over how your data persists.iCloud에 앱과 사용자의 정보를 저장할 수 있는 다양한 방법이 있습니다. 이 아티클은 당신의 앱에 대한 다양한 옵션들과 적합성에 대해서 설명합니다. 각 옵션에는 복잡성, iCloud 기능 엑세스, 데이터 지속 방식 제어 등의 trade-off가 있습니다.\nConsider the following approaches before you choose CloudKit.CloudKit을 선택하기 전에 다음 방법들을 고려하세요.\n\nStore Data as Files\n파일로 데이터 저장하기\nIf your app stores data as files and you want those files to sync across devices, you can use iCloud document storage. This storage option gives you granular control over which files to sync. Choosing to store your data as files affords the least control over how your data persists to iCloud, but is relatively simple.만약 앱이 데이터를 파일로 저장하거나 파일들을 기기 간에 동기화시키고 싶다면, iCloud document 저장소를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 저장소 옵션을 사용하면 동기화할 파일을 세밀하게 제어할 수 있습니다. 데이터를 파일로 저장하는 것을 선택하면 데이터가 iCloud에 유지되는 방식을 가장 적게 제어할 수 있지만 비교적으로 간단합니다.\nTo use iCloud document storage, use url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier:) in FileManager. For more information, see Designing for Documents in iCloud.iCloud document 저장소를 사용하려면, FileManager의 url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier:)를 사용하세요. 정보를 더 얻고 싶다면 Designing for Documents in iCloud를 참고하세요.\nIf your files reside on a single device, you can save them using the nonubiquity methods of FileManager. When a user enables iCloud Backup, a snapshot of these files uploads to iCloud. The user can then restore a device using that snapshot. Note that your app’s data contributes to the overall device backup size. A large total backup size can lead to lengthy restore times. See iCloud Backup.만약 파일이 하나의 기기에 있다면, FileManager의 nonubiquity 메서드를 사용하여 저장할 수 있습니다. 사용자가 iCloud 백업을 이용할 수 있을 때, 이 파일들의 스냅샷이 iCloud에 업로드 됩니다. 사용자는 이 스냅샷을 가지고 기기에 다시 저장할 수 있습니다. 앱의 데이터는 전체 기기의 백업 크기에 영향을 미칩니다. 백업할 데이터가 많아지면 복원하는데에 시간이 오래걸립니다. iCloud Backup을 참고하세요.\n\nStore Unstructured Data That Syncs Across Devices\n기기 간에 동기화되는 구조화되지 않은 데이터 저장하기\nIf you store a small number of key-value pairs that sync across the user’s devices, you can use iCloud key-value storage. This approach is simple but doesn’t provide control over how data persists, and it limits the kind of data you can store.만약 사용자의 기기 간에 동기화시킬 적은 수의 키-값들을 저장한다면, iCloud key-value 저장소를 사용할 수 있습니다. 간단한 방법이지만 데이터가 유지되는 방법에 대한 제어를 제공하지는 않고, 저장할 수 있는 데이터 종류에 제한이 있습니다.\nYou can store up to 1,024 pairs of string keys to scalar values. The value types supported are Bool, numeric types, String, Date, Data, Array, and Dictionary. You might use this solution to store a user’s preferences or game state as property lists, for example. For more information, see NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.1024개까지 문자열 키와 스칼라 값의 짝을 저장할 수 있습니다. 값 타입으로는 Bool, 숫자, String, Date, Data, Array, Dictionary 타입들을 지원합니다. 아마 사용자의 설정이나 프로퍼티 리스트로 저장된 게임의 상태 등을 저장하는데에 사용하게 될 것입니다. 정보를 더 얻고 싶다면 NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore를 참고하세요.\n\nStore Objects That Sync Across Devices\n기기 간에 동기화되는 객체 저장하기\nIf you store your data as objects and relationships, consider using Core Data with CloudKit, or using CloudKit directly. Using CloudKit directly is more complex, but it gives you full control over the data you store, including the design and management of your container’s schema. Use this option if you want direct access to iCloud storage features, such as private data sharing, or if you want to manage local data caching. With a local cache of data, your app can reduce the number of calls to iCloud and can access cached data offline.만약 객체와 관계로 데이터를 저장할 경우, CloudKit과 Core Data를 함께 사용하거나, CloudKit을 직접적으로 사용할 수 있습니다. CloudKit을 직접적으로 사용하는 것은 복잡하지만 데이터를 저장하는데에 있어서 디자인이나 컨테이너의 스키마 관리 등 모든 권한을 얻을 수 있습니다. 개인 정보를 공유하거나 로컬 데이터 캐싱을 관리하고 싶을 때 iCloud 저장소 기능에 직접 접근하고 싶다면 이 옵션을 사용하세요. 로컬 데이터 캐시를 사용하면 iCloud 호출 수를 줄이고 오프라인에서 캐시된 데이터에 액세스할 수 있습니다.\nIf you only sync private data and you don’t need granular control over which data syncs, you can use Core Data with CloudKit. Core Data with CloudKit stores a local replica of a CloudKit private database and syncs it across all of the user’s devices. This storage option doesn’t support all CloudKit features—for example, it doesn’t support live queries and shared private data—but can be simpler than using CloudKit directly. Core Data with CloudKit manages the schema for your iCloud container, so you don’t have to.개인 데이터만 동기화하고 데이터 도익화를 세밀하게 제어할 필요가 없는 경우 CloudKit과 함께 Core Data를 사용할 수 있습니다. CloudKit을 사용한 Core Data는 개인 데이터 베이스의 로컬 복제본을 저장하고 사용자의 모든 기기에 동기화합니다. 이 저장소 옵션은 실시간 쿼리나 개인 데이터 공유 등 CloudKit의 모든 기능을 제공하지는 않지만 CloudKit을 직접적으로 사용하는 것보다 간단할 수 있습니다. CloudKit을 사용한 Core Data는 iCloud 컨테이너의 스키마를 관리하므로 사용자가 관리할 필요가 없습니다.\nTo get started with CloudKit, see Enabling CloudKit in Your App. For more information on Core Data with CloudKit, see Setting Up Core Data with CloudKit.CloudKit을 시작하려면 Enabling CloudKit in Your App를 확인하세요. CloudKit을 이용한 Core Data에 대해서 더 정보를 얻고 싶다면 Setting Up Core Data with CloudKit를 확인해주세요.\n"},"articles/Receiving and Handling Events with Combine.html":{"url":"articles/Receiving and Handling Events with Combine.html","title":"Receiving and Handling Events with Combine","keywords":"","body":"Receiving and Handling Events with Combine\n컴바인을 활용해 이벤트를 받고, 다루어 봅시다.\nCustomize and receive events from asynchronous sources.비동기 소스로부터 이벤트를 받고 조작해봅시다.\n\nOverview \n개요\nThe Combine framework provides a declarative approach for how your app processes events. Rather than potentially implementing multiple delegate callbacks or completion handler closures, you can create a single processing chain for a given event source. Each part of the chain is a Combine operator that performs a distinct action on the elements received from the previous step. Combine 프레임워크는 앱이 이벤트를 처리하는 방식에 대한 선언적 접근방식을 제공합니다. 당신은 잠재적으로 여러 딜리게이트 콜백이나, 컴플리션 핸들러를 구현하는 대신, 지정된 이벤트 소스에 대한 단일 처리 체인을 만들 수 있습니다. 체인의 각 부분은 이전 단계에서 받은 요소에 대해 고유한 작업을 진행하는 Combine의 연산자입니다.\n Consider an app that needs to filter a table or collection view based on the contents of a text field. In AppKit, each keystroke in the text field produces a Notification that you can subscribe to with Combine. After receiving the notification, you can use operators to change the content and timing of event delivery, and use the final result to update your app’s user interface.     \n텍스트 필드의 내용을 바탕으로 테이블이나 컬렉션 뷰를 필터링해야하는 앱을 고려해봅시다. AppKit 에서, 텍스트 필드의 각 키에 대한 입력은 컴바인을 통해 구동할 수 있는 Notification을 만들어냅니다. Notification을 받은 이후에, 당신은 연산자를 사용하여 전달된 이벤트의 내용과 시간을 변경하거나, 최종 결과물을 토대로 앱의 UI를 업데이트할 수 있습니다. \n\nConnext a Publisher to a Subscriber.\nPublisher(게시자) 와 Subscriber(구독자) 를 연결해봅시다.\nTo receive the text field’s notifications with Combine, access the default instance of NotificationCenter and call its publisher(for:object:) method. This call takes the notification name and source object that you want notifications from, and returns a publisher that produces notification elements.Combine으로 텍스트필드의 알림을 전달받기 위해선,NotificationCenter 의 default 인스턴스에 접근하여, publisher(for:object:) 메서드를 호출해야합니다. 이 호출은 알림을 받을 이름과 소스 객체를 사용하고, 알림 요소를 생성해내는 publisher 를 반환합니다.\nlet pub = NotificationCenter.default    \n        .publisher(for: NSControl.textDidChangeNotification, object: filterField)\n\nYou use a Subscriber to receive elements from the publisher. The subscriber defines an associated type, Input, to declare the type that it receives. The publisher also defines a type, Output, to declare what it produces. The publisher and subscriber both define a type, Failure, to indicate the kind of error they produce or receive. To connect a subscriber to a producer, the Output must match the Input, and the Failure types must also match.Subscriber 를 활용하여 publisher 로부터 요소들을 전달받을 수 있습니다. Subscriber 는  Input 이라는 전달받을 연관 타입을 정의합니다. Publisher  역시 Output이라는 만들어낼 연관 타입을 정의합니다. Publisher 와 subscriber 는 모두 생성하거나, 수신할 때 발생하는 문제 나타내는 Failure라는 타입을 정의합니다. Subscriber 와 publisher를 서로 매칭하기 위해서는, Output과 Input 타입 그리고 각자의 Failure 타입이 서로 같아야합니다.\nCombine provides two built-in subscribers, which automatically match the output and failure types of their attached publisher:Combine은 output 과 failure 타입을 자동으로 매칭하는 두 개의 Subscriber 를 기본적으로 제공합니다. \n\nsink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) ) takes two closures. The first closure executes when it receives Subscribers.Completion, which is an enumeration that indicates whether the publisher finished normally or failed with an error. The second closure executes when it receives an element from the publisher.  sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) ) 는 두 개의 클로저를 갖습니다. 첫 번째 클로저는 Subscribers.Completion 을 수신할 때 실행되며, 이는 Publisher 가 정상적으로 작업을 마무리 지었는지, 혹은 에러와 함께 실패했는지를 드러내는 열거형입니다. 두 번째 클로저는 Publisher 로 부터 요소를 수신할 때 실행됩니다.\nassign(to:on:)) immediately assigns every element it receives to a property of a given object, using a key path to indicate the property.  assign(to:on:)) 은 주어진 객체의 프로퍼티에 전달받은 모든 요소를 즉각적으로 할당합니다. 이 때, 키패스를 사용해 프로퍼티를 가리킵니다.\n\nFor example, you can use the sink subscriber to log when the publisher completes, and each time it receives an element:예를 들어, publisher 가 작업을 마쳤을 때, 그리고 요소를 수신받는 각각의 시점에 sink subscriber 를 사용할 수 있습니다.\nlet sub = NotificationCenter.default    \n        .publisher(for: NSControl.textDidChangeNotification, object: filterField)    \n        .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ($0) },          \n                    receiveValue: { print ($0) })\n\nBoth the sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) and assign(to:on:)) subscribers request an unlimited number of elements from their publishers. To control the rate at which you receive elements, create your own subscriber by implementing the Subscriber protocol.sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) 와 assign(to:on:)) subscriber는 둘 다 publisher로 부터 요소들을 제약없이 전달받습니다. 전달받을 요소들을 제어하기 위해선, 직접 Subscriber 프로토콜을 채택해 자신만의 subscriber를 만들 수 있습니다.\n\nChange the Output Type with Operators\nOperator를 활용해 Output 타입을 변경해봅시다.\nThe sink subscriber in the previous section performs all its work in the receiveValue closure. This could be burdensome if it needs to perform a lot of custom work with received elements or maintain state between invocations. The advantage of Combine comes from combining operators to customize event delivery.이전 섹션에서 다루었던 sink subscriber는 receiveValue클로저에서 모든 작업을 수행합니다.  만약 전달받은 요소를 바탕으로 많은 사용자 정의 작업을 수행해야하거나, 호출들 사이에서 상태를 유지해야하는 상황이라면, 이는 부담이 될 수도 있습니다.\nFor example, NotificationCenter.Publisher.Output isn’t a convenient type to receive in the callback if all you need is the text field’s string value. Since a publisher’s output is essentially a sequence of elements over time, Combine offers sequence-modifying operators like map(_:)-99evh), flatMap(maxPublishers:_:)-3k7z5), and reduce(_:_:)). The behavior of these operators is similar to their equivalents in the Swift standard library.예를들어, NotificationCenter.Publisher.Output 과 같은 타입은 텍스트 필드의 문자열 값만을 필요로 하는 경우, 콜백을 통해 전달받기에 편리하한 타입이 아닙니다. Publisher의 output 은 결국 시간에 따른 일련의 요소이므로, Combine 은 map(_:)-99evh), flatMap(maxPublishers:_:)-3k7z5),  reduce(_:_:))와 같이 순서를 조정하는 연산자를 제공합니다. 이러한 연산자들의 동작은 Swift standard library 의 그것과 비슷합니다. \nTo change the output type of the publisher, you add a map(_:)-99evh)operator whose closure returns a different type. In this case, you can get the notification’s object as an NSTextField, and then get the field’s stringValue.Publisher 의 Output 타입을 변경하기 위해서는, 다른 타입을 반환하는 클로저를 갖는 map(_:)-99evh) 연산자를 추가해야합니다. 텍스트 필드의 경우, Notification의 객체를 NSTextField 타입으로 가져온 후, stringValue 를 꺼내올 수 있습니다.\nlet sub = NotificationCenter.default    \n    .publisher(for: NSControl.textDidChangeNotification, object: filterField)    \n    .map( { ($0.object as! NSTextField).stringValue } )    \n    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ($0) },          \n                receiveValue: { print ($0) })\n\nAfter the publisher chain produces the type you want, replace sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) with assign(to:on:)). The following example takes the strings it receives from the publisher chain and assigns them to the filterString of a custom view model object:Publisher 체인은 우리가 원하는 타입을 만들어낸 이후에, sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) 를 assign(to:on:)) 로 대체할 수 있습니다. 아래의 예시는 Publisher 체인으로부터 문자열을 받고, 이를 view model 객체의 filterString 에 할당하고 있습니다. \nlet sub = NotificationCenter.default    \n        .publisher(for: NSControl.textDidChangeNotification, object: filterField)    \n        .map( { ($0.object as! NSTextField).stringValue } )    \n        .assign(to: \\MyViewModel.filterString, on: myViewModel)\n\n\nCustomize Publishers with Operators\n연산자를 활용해 Publisher를 사용자정의 해봅시다.\nYou can extend the Publisher instance with an operator that performs actions that you’d otherwise need to code manually. Here are three ways you could use operators to improve this event-processing chain:기존이라면 우리가 수동으로 코딩해야하는 작업들을, Publisher 인스턴스에 연산자를 활용해 확장할 수 있습니다.\n\nRather than updating the view model with any string typed into the text field, you could use the filter(_:)) operator to ignore input under a certain length or to reject non-alphanumeric characters.  텍스트 필드에 입력된 문자열로 view model을 업데이트하는 대신, filter(_:)) 연산자를 활용해 특정 길이 미만의 입력값을 무시하거나, 영문/숫자가 아닌 문자를 거부할 수 있습니다.\nIf the filtering operation is expensive — for example, if it’s querying a large database — you might want to wait for the user to stop typing. For this, the debounce(for:scheduler:options:)) operator lets you set a minimum period of time that must elapse before a publisher emits an event. The RunLoop class provides conveniences for specifying the time delay in seconds or milliseconds.  변별 작업이 오래 걸리는 경우 (예를 들어, 대규모의 데이터베이스를 선별하는 경우) 사용자가 타이핑을 멈출 때까지 잠시 기다리기를 원하기도 합니다. debounce(for:scheduler:options:)) 연산자를 활용하면, Publisher가 이벤트를 발생시키기 전에 경과해야하는 최고 시간을 설정할 수 있습니다.  RunLoop 클래스는 초단위 혹은 밀리초단위의 지연 시간을 쉽게 지정할 수 있도록 돕습니다.\nIf the results update the UI, you can deliver callbacks to the main thread by calling the receive(on:options:)) method. By specifying the Scheduler instance provided by the RunLoop class as the first parameter, you tell Combine to call your subscriber on the main run loop.  만약 결과물이 UI를 업데이트해야한다면, receive(on:options:)) 메서드를 호출해 콜백함수를 메인 스레드로 옮길 수 있습니다. RunLoop 클래스에서 제공하는  Scheduler 인스턴스를 첫번째 매개변수로 지정함으로써, subscriber를 메인 런루프에서 호출하도록 지시할 수 있습니다.\n\nThe resulting publisher declaration follows:선언된 Publisher는 다음과 같습니다.\nlet sub = NotificationCenter.default    \n        .publisher(for: NSControl.textDidChangeNotification, object: filterField)    \n        .map( { ($0.object as! NSTextField).stringValue } )    \n        .filter( { $0.unicodeScalars.allSatisfy({CharacterSet.alphanumerics.contains($0)}) } )    \n        .debounce(for: .milliseconds(500), scheduler: RunLoop.main)    \n        .receive(on: RunLoop.main)    \n        .assign(to:\\MyViewModel.filterString, on: myViewModel)\n\n\nCancel Publishing when Desired\n원하는 시점에 발행을 취소해봅시다.\nA publisher continues to emit elements until it completes normally or fails. If you no longer want to subscribe to the publisher, you can cancel the subscription. The subscriber types created by sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) and assign(to:on:)) both implement the Cancellable protocol, which provides a cancel()) method:Publisher 는 작업이 완료되거나, 실패할때까지 요소들을 계속적으로 내보냅니다. 만약, 더이상 Publisher를 구독하고 싶지 않다면, 구독을 취소할 수 있습니다. Subscriber 타입들은 Cancellable 프로토콜을 구현하는  sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) 나 assign(to:on:))  메서드에 의해 생성됩니다. Cancellable 프로토콜은  cancel()) 메서드를 제공하고 있습니다.\nsub?.cancel()\n\nIf you create a custom Subscriber, the publisher sends a Subscription object when you first subscribe to it. Store this subscription, and then call its cancel()) method when you want to cancel publishing. When you create a custom subscriber, you should implement the Cancellable protocol, and have your cancel()) implementation forward the call to the stored subscription.만약 당신이 Subscriber 를 직접 생성한다면, Publisher는 자신이 처음 구독되는 시점에 Subscription 객체를 전달합니다. 전달된 Subscription 객체를 저장한 후, 발행을 취소하고 싶을 때 cancel()) 메서드를 호출해봅시다. 사용자 정의 Subscriber를 직접 생성할 때, 우리는 반드시 Cancellable 프로토콜을 채택해 구현해야합니다. 그리고 구현한 cancel()) 메서드가 저장된 subscription으로 호출을 전달하도록 해야합니다.\n"}}}
